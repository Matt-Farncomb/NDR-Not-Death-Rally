A death rally like top down racing game where the players are encouraged to cheat.

Cheating
* It's in-game cheating.
* Players can hack cars mid race and even slash tires before the race.
* Hackers/Cheaters are targeted by other cars if caught.
* Also, bets can be placed on races so slashing tires can help you win the bet.
* IF bets are placed on you and you win/lose when you should have done otherwise, enemies will come after you too.
